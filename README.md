# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

Overview of the analysis:
     The purpose of this project was to identify the number and type of employees that will be retiring in the near future at Pewlett-Hackard.

Results:
1.)	72,458 employees are eligible to retire
2.)	7 unique job titles will have to be replaced
3.)	About 70% of the potential retirees are in senior positions
4.)	1,549 employees can serve as mentors

Summary:
     The effect of the wave of 72,458 employees that will soon leave Pewlett-Hackard can be mitigated by the 1,549 available mentors, but only to a certain degree. The average age of this near retirement group is about 68, and most of them have over 30 years of experience at the company. This means Pewlett-Hackard is most likely going to have to hire experienced employees, while also bolstering its entry-level pipelines.
